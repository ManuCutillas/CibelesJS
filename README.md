# CibelesJS

A framework with the best features of a platform that fits in a library.
Based on an ontology.
This new framework will be innovative and deliver value at all stages of a software project.

Named "The most promising framework of 2017" by Node.js Madrid.

## Rationale

There are not many JavaScript frameworks "Made in Spain".
This one will be adapted to the idiosyncrasy of our beautiful country,
with built-in censorship capabilities and a software factory approach:
it will allow analysts to specify the work
and programmers to actually write the code.

## Plugins

Currently there is only one plugin,
aptly called "censorship".
Please contribute your own with a [pull request](https://github.com/madridjs/CibelesJS#fork-destination-box).

## Philosophy

We are still deciding if we want to build a framework, a platform or a library.
Can you [help us](https://twitter.com/pinchito/status/814114186124992513) make up our collective mind?

## Roadmap

* Versions 0.x: in development, planned until 2018.
* CibelesJS (aka Cibeles1): the first version.
* Cibeles2 (aka Cibeles): the gritty reboot.
* Cibeles Forever (aka Cibelitas): the much-awaited sequel.
